## Steps taken with AI
- Created data models and a Flask endpoint.

- Implemented the core calculation.
- Code Review with CodeRabbit

## My contributions
- Design the various components.

- Integrate several AI bots' responses into a single, readable, and efficient solution.
- Refactor the code.
- Ensure everything works.

## For scaling
- Use different binaries for yahoo client and the prediction service
- Containerize and add kubernetes for autoscaling managment
- Put the above services in different pods so they could scale seperately
- Add in memory caching and distibuted caching (like redis) to s&p 500 and requested stocks
- Add database for past queries. I would use mongo because of its dynamic nature. It can store json like data which is very dynamic.
- Add queueing for long running predictions
- Use FastAPI for async operations.
